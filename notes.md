## General notes
- Every transition point of the path between two minima lies on the border of at least two basin of attractions
- 

# Goals
- Resulting basins should be grid-size invariant (consider that the direct neighbors generated by molgri adjacency might not be sufficient for this purpose as rotational and translational step size might be dependent on the resolution / step magnitude in each direction as defined by their grid dimensions. Considering all possible neighbors, all 3^N possible steps, this should be avoidable)
- There should be no redundant execution of steepest descent, each trajectory point should be updated as soon as a minimum, or a point known to converge to a minimum, is found.
- The algorithm should be applicable to arbitrary dimensional grids created by molgri
- The resulting basin of attraction should be visualized (at least the translation components)
- It should be possible to generate and save efficiently a path from any point in the grid

# Future plans
- Molgri diagonal neighbors
- implement Lennard Jones Potential in 3D ()
- Positionen der Teilchen (je LJ Potential hexagonales cluster LJ Teilchen)
